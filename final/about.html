                    excellence. Founded in 1926, the company has consistently pushed the boundaries of automotive technology. In recent years, 
                    Mercedes-Benz has focused on modernization by developing electric and hybrid vehicles under the "EQ" brand, 
                    such as the EQS, their flagship electric sedan. The brand emphasizes sustainability, aiming for a carbon-neutral 
                    future with their "Ambition 2039" initiative. <abbr title="Advanced Driver Assistance Systems">ADAS</abbr>, including autonomous 
                    driving features, have been integrated into newer models. Mercedes-Benz also prioritizes digitalization, 
                    offering AI-powered infotainment systems like MBUX, which uses natural language processing. 
                    The brand's commitment to modern design and cutting-edge technology maintains its reputation as a leader in the 
                    luxury automotive market.</i>
